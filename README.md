# AQ-Monitor
This project takes two air-quality readings namely Carbon dioxide and Total Volatile Organic Compounds from the database.
These readings are captured using a Rasberry PI and logged to a SQLite3 database.
We then use these values to plot a line chart indicating changes in air-quality throughout the day.
